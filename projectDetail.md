ed - editor
Project type: hobby toy project -> work only on saturday's recreational programming session. no stress, all chill. 

Project description:
personalised code editor for my usage. will try to learn as much as possible, however making it from scratch is not the goal. i will use library if i make my life a lot easier 
Langauge : TS/Electron, since i am most familiar with it at this stage. + i haven't worked on a single desktop application. so maybe it is too much for me to begin with c++ or c at this point. so i will make this in js, if on future i feel conformtable i can use c++/c


v0. features:
1. Distraction Free UI
2. keyboard mapping
3. syntax highlighting
4. inbuilt terminal support
5. git status trees
6. file tree
7. fast as it gets
